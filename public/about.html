<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Indrayani Vaishnav, a 21-year-old student studying at Veermata Jijabai Technological 
  Institute in Mumbai. Originally from Aurangabad, I'm currently in my final year of Electrical Engineering,
  and I couldn't be more excited about it! One of my biggest passions is coding. I love diving into the world
  of programming and exploring the endless possibilities it offers. I'm quite proficient in languages like
  C++, Java, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I've spent a lot of time honing my skills,
  and it's paid offâ€”I feel confident in my abilities as a coder.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic journey, I've taken on various coding projects and assignments. It's been an 
  incredible learning experience, and I'm proud of how far I've come. Writing clean,efficient code is 
  something I'm particularly good at, and my peers and professors have recognizedand appreciated that. 
  Problem-solving is another aspect of coding that I thoroughly enjoy. I find it exhilarating to tackle 
  complex challenges and come up with creative solutions. Over time, I've developed strong analytical 
  skills that help me identify and overcome coding obstacles effectively.</p>

<p>But it's not just about technical skills for me. I believe in the power of teamwork and collaboration.
  I love being part of group discussions,where I can share my ideas and learn from others. My communication
  skills have also been a great asset in working with diverse teams and adapting to different environments. 
  As I approach the end of my electrical engineering journey, I'm feeling prepared and excited for what's to come. 
  The combination of my technical knowledge and programming skills opens up a world of opportunities in the tech 
  industry. I'm ready to take onnew challenges, continue learning, and make a positive impact in the field.</p>
